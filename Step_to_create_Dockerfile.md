# Docker Project for DevOps Engineers.

### Before moving to project on Docker.Let's understand what is Dockerfile.

# Dockerfile

- A **`Dockerfile`** is like a set of instructions for making a container. It tells Docker `what base image to use`, `what commands to run` and `what files to include`. 
- For example, if you were making a container for a website, the Dockerfile might tell Docker to use an official web server image, copy the files for your website into the container, and start the web server when the container starts.

---
## Basic need for a Dockerfile are as follow:

- **Specify the base image** **`(FROM)`**: The first line of a Dockerfile should specify the base image that the **Docker image** will be built upon. This can be a minimal operating system image or a **pre-built image** that includes a specific software stack.{eg.`FROM node`}

- **Install dependencies** **`(RUN)`**: If your application has dependencies, you need to install them in the Docker image. This can be done using the `RUN` command in the Dockerfile.

- **Copy application files** **`(COPY)`**: After installing dependencies, you need to copy your application files into the Docker image. This can be done using the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile.

- **Set environment variables** **`(ENV)`**: You can set environment variables in the Dockerfile that will be used by your application. This can be done using the `ENV` command in the Dockerfile.

- **Expose ports** **`(EXPOSE)`**: If your application listens on a specific port, you need to expose that port in the Docker image. This can be done using the `EXPOSE` command in the Dockerfile.

- **Define the command to run** **`(CMD)`**: Finally, you need to specify the command that Docker will use to run your application inside the container. This can be done using the `CMD` command in the Dockerfile.

# Tasks:

### Create a Dockerfile for a simple web application.

### Verify that the application is working as expected by accessing it in a web browser
